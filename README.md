# Loan-Credit-Default-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Prediction
This repository contains exploratory Data analysis to a bank loan default dataset. This is done in order to clean the data and make it usable for machine learning prediction.

Observation on Data Analysis: 
- Highly correlated variables are (Applicant's Income & Loan Amount) and (Credit History & Loan Status)

Feature Engineering:
- Total Income: Combined the Applicant Income and Co-applicant Income. If the total income is high, chances of loan approvalmight also be high.
- EMI: EMI is the monthly amount to be paid by the applicant to repay the loan. Idea behind making this variable is that people who have high EMIâ€™s might find it difficult to pay back the loan. We can calculate the EMI by taking the ratio of loan amount with respect to loan amount term.
- Balance Income: This is the income left after the EMI has been paid. Idea behind creating this variable is that if this value is high, the chances are high that a person will repay the loan and hence increasing the chances of loan approval.
